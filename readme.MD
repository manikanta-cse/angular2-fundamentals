Angular 2 Fundamentals 
========================

Getting Started
---------------
Be sure you're running the recommended node version, which is 6.3.0+: `node --version`

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory 

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
